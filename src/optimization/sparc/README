This contains functions that replace the Numerical Recipes realft()
function.  These functions use the optimized FFT's from the Sun
Performance Library.

The executable realft constructs a short input sequence, then does a
forward Numerical Recipes realft() and prints out the resulting array.
It then takes an identical input array, and does a forward transform
using the Sun Performance Library routine.  The comparison between the
two outputs lets you easily see the difference in packing order.

The module realft_sparc.c/o contains a replacement for the Numerical
Recipes realft() routine which takes identical arguments and internally
makes use of the Sun Performance Library to do the fft.  On first entry,
and anytime that the size of the array changes, it prints a notification
message to standard error.

The executables realft_sparc_test1 and realft_sparc_test2 are identical
source code, but the first is linked with the Numerical Recipes library
and the second is linked with the realft_sparc.o routine.  By comparing
the outputs of these programs (which do one forward and one inverse FFT),
which are identical except for rounding error, you can verify that the
replacement for the realft() routine is working correctly.
