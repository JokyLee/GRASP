This directory contains code routines to optimize GRASP execution running
on different hardware platforms.

The prototypical example is this:

You have an optimized FFT routine available in a library, but it does
not take it's input/output in the same format at the Numerical Recipes
(NR) routines function realft().  So you write a block of code that:
(1) takes the arguments, and moves them from the NR format
    assumed by realft() into the format that your optimized FFT needs.

(2) does the optimized FFT

(3) takes the output of that optimized FFT and puts it back into NR format
    again.

You then compile this block of code into a .o file, and link it in with
the GRASP package, BEFORE you link the NR library.

The different directories below this directory typically contain glue
routines for particular machine types.  We are distributing the .o
files with GRASP but you may need to re-build these glue object files.
If so, edit the makefile in the particular directory, and type "make".

Generally, these directories contain following files:
makefile ............... The makefile to build the optimized glue routine.

printvec.c ............. Routine to print out arrays.  Should require no
                         modification for a new machine or FFT.
realft.c ............... Test program, prints out a Numerical Recipes
                         forward/back FFT, and the optimized lib FFT for
		         comparison.  Helps to understand packing convention.
realft_machine.c ....... Contains glue routine that makes machine-specific
                         optimized FFT obey Numerical Recipes syntax.
realft_machine.o ....... Object file that previous .c file compiles into.
                         Should be linked to code that uses realft().
realft_machine_test.c .. A routine to test the optimzed FFT.
realft_machine_test1 ... Previous .c file, linked to Numerical Recipes.
realft_machine_test2 ... Previous .c file, linked to optimized FFT

To test the optimzed FFT, use a set of commands like:

realft_machine_test1 >! numer_rec_test.out
realft_machine_test2 >! optimized_test.out
paste numer_rec_test.out optimized_test.out | more

When you do this, the left hand side of the screen will show the
output of the test program realft_machine_test.c when linked with
numerical recipes.  The right hand side of the screen should show the
output of the same test program realft_machine_test.c, but now linked
with the optimized FFT.  The left and right columns should agree, up
to possible rounding errors.
