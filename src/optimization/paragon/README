This contains functions that replace the Numerical Recipes realft()
function.  One of these replacements is guaranteed, and uses memcpy to
copy the inputs before doing the FFT.  The other replacement does not
do this, but rather makes the (risky) assumption that the data segment
extends 8 bytes below the furthest malloc()'d address, and makes use of
the extra space.  If the risky version generates segmentation violations,
use the safe one!

These functions use the optimized FFT's from the paragon CLASSPACK
library.
