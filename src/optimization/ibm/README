This contains functions that replace the Numerical Recipes realft()
function.  This replacement makes the (risky) assumption that the data
segment extends 8 bytes below the furthest malloc()'d address, and
makes use of the extra space.  If the risky version generates
segmentation violations, use the safe one!

These functions use the optimized FFT's from the IBM ESSL library.
