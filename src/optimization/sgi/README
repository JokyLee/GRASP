This contains functions that replace the Numerical Recipes realft()
function.  The replacement makes the (risky) assumption that the data segment
extends 8 bytes below the furthest malloc()'d address, and makes use of
the extra space.  If the risky version generates segmentation violations,
write a safe on that uses memcpy.  See the paragon example.

These functions use the optimized FFT's from the Cray/SGI scientific
library.
