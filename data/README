This directory should contain links to the directories
containing data sets from different IFO runs.

Instructions on how to get data may be found on the LIGO Scientific
Collaboration Web Page:

FRAME FORMAT DATA

After using tar to read the data off magnetic tape, you will
have a collection of directories with names like:

14nov94.1.frame/ 14nov94.2.frame/ 18nov94.1.frame/ 18nov94.2.frame/
19nov94.1.frame/ 19nov94.2.frame/ 19nov94.3.frame/ 19nov94.4.frame/
20nov94.1.frame/ 20nov94.2.frame/ 20nov94.3.frame/

Our advice: set up links to the files in these directories as follows.
Assume that GRASP is installed in /usr/local/GRASP, so that what you
are currently reading is the file /usr/local/GRASP/data/README.
In other words you are now in the directory /usr/local/GRASP/data/.
Suppose that the actual data is directories under /bigdisk, i.e. in
/bigdisk/14nov94.1.frame/C1-*  /bigdisk/14nov94.2.frame/C1-* and so on.
Then use the following commands:

tcsh
cd /usr/local/GRASP/data/
foreach i (/bigdisk/*.frame/C1-*)
ln -s $i
echo "done linking file " $i
end
exit

This will create links in this data directory to all the frame files.

**************************************************************************
OLD FORMAT DATA:
Suppose that GRASP is installed in /usr/local/GRASP

Suppose that the 40 meter data is in a directory
called /data.  So for example:
ls /data
14nov94.1/   14nov94.2/   19nov94.1/   19nov94.2/   19nov94.3/ 19nov94.4/
18nov94.1/   18nov94.2/   20nov94.1/   20nov94.2/   20nov94.3/
lost+found/

You can establish these links by typing:
foreach i (/data/*)
? ln -s $i /usr/local/GRASP/data
? end

(Note that you must specify complete (not relative) paths!

After setting up these links, all of your users can locate the
data in /usr/local/GRASP/data.  Be sure to write protect it!
