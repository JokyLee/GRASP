detectors.dat is documented in the users manual.  It contains a one-line
   description of detectors sites and orientations.

noise*.dat contains the strain/rHz sensitivity expected of various
   detectors, in two column format (freq, strain/rHz)

whiten*.dat contains two column descriptions of whitening filters.
   In principle all physics results are independent of these.

NOTES ON ENHANCED DETECTORS:
   The enhanced detector configurations given here have been through
   several revisions.  The files ligo-{0-7}.dat contain the incremental
   steps from the initial interferometer LIGO-I to the final enhanced
   configuration LIGO-II which were originally planned when R&D for
   enhanced interferometers began.  Because of the tremendous effort
   required to develop and operate an interferometer, this plan was
   abandoned in favor of jumping directly to a "final" enhanced
   configuration (after an extra year of R&D).  The noise curves
   describing this LIGO-II are given in the LSC White Paper.

   The file noise_whitepaper2.dat contains data corresponding to
   curve 2, Figure 1 of the White Paper.  It is a configuration for
   an interferometer that has been been optimized to detect binary
   inspiral signals.

   The file noise_whitepaper7.dat contains data corresponding to
   curve 7, Figure 1 of the White Paper.  It is a configuration for
   an interferometer that has been optimized to give good broad-band
   sensitivity over a band from (several) 10 Hz to (several) 100 Hz
   (note that it is broader but less deep than noise_whitepaper2.dat).

   The file noise_whitepaper1.dat contains data corresponding to curve 1,
   Figure 1 of the White Paper.  This is LIGO-I as given in the White
   Paper; it is essentially identical to ligo-0.dat.

   The file noise_sens270.dat is an obselete version of curve2, given to
   Bruce Allen by Ken Strain in July 1999.  It has now been superseded
   by noise_whitepaper2.dat, but is kept for the record.

NB: the files noise_whitepaper{1,2,7}.dat were generated by extracting
   data directly from the Postscript file corresponding to Figure 1 in
   the White Paper!  It is therefore almost certain that they are at least
   slightly inaccurate.  In the very near future, someone should ask Ken
   Strain to provide the data files that were used to generate that plot.
